# DEPLOYMENT
## How to deploy this web app
Open the 'Frontend and Backend Code' folder.

Go to 'Login or Registration Code' folder.

Open the 'index.html' file using XAMPP.

Once the file opens using your browser, and if you have never registered you'll have to register first then login.

When you are your credentials are valid, yu will be redirected to the 'dotask.html' which is found in the 'ToDoTask code' folder.

Once you are redirected to the 'dotask.html' you will be able to submit your task since the it contains the code which enables ones to add tasks.

N.B: I used used XAMPP as my server therefore the redirection only works if you open the'index.html' file using XAMPP.
